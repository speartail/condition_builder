= condition_builder

ConditionBuilder generates conditions and criteria for use in ActiveRecord .find
statements to avoid manually having to construct a string of conditions and
the releveant hash with values.

It does not support fancy dependencies between the statements as it would make
the syntax so complicated that people might as well generate the condition
string and hash themselves.

= Usage

 cb = ConditionBuilder.new
 # add a condition "user_id < 4" in descending order
 cb.add('user_id <', 4, :desc)
 # add a condition "user_location like '%abc'" in ascending order
 cb.add('user_location like', '%abc', :asc)
 # add a condition "department_id = 18"
 cb.add('department_id = ', 18)
 
 User.find(:all, :conditions => cb.conditions, :order => cb.order, cb.criteria)
